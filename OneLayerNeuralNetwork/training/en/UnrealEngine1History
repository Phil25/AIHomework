Development of the first generation Unreal Engine was carried out by the founder of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.[4] Inspired by John Carmack's pioneering programming work on Doom and then Quake,[4] Sweeney started the engine in 1995 for the production of a game that would later become known as Unreal, a first-person shooter set in a medieval world with alien elements.[5][6] After three years of development, it debuted with the game's release in 1998,[7] although licensees such as MicroProse and Legend Entertainment had possessed the technology much earlier, with the first licensing deal taking place in 1996.[8]

Both software and hardware rendering were present in the foundational software, as well as collision detection, colored lighting, and a rudimentary version of texture filtering.[9] The engine also provided a level editor, called UnrealEd,[10] that had support for real-time constructive solid geometry operations as early as 1996, allowing mappers to change the level layout "on the fly".[11][12] Other features implemented during development included real-time direct illumination and light sourcing, which were respectively integrated in 1995 and 1997.[13][14] In addition to having support for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac,[15] Unreal Tournament also opened the platform to PlayStation 2 and, with the help of Secret Level, to Dreamcast.[16][17] In 2000, Epic updated the engine with new improvements, including higher-polygon models and architecture, a skeletal animation system and large-scale terrain support.[18]

By late 1999, The New York Times indicated that the number of projects using Epic's technology was 16, naming the likes of Deus Ex, Nerf Arena Blast and Duke Nukem Forever,[15] the title from 3D Realms that was set to debut the series on the GameCube console.[19] While it cost around $3 million to produce and licenses for up to $350,000,[15] Epic gave modders the ability to create their own worlds with the incorporation of UnrealEd and a scripting language called UnrealScript in its games, sparking a community of enthusiasts around a game engine that was built to be extensible and improved over multiple generations of games.[20][21][22]

The big goal with the Unreal technology all long was to build up a base of code that could be extended and improved through many generations of games. Meeting that goal required keeping the technology quite general-purpose, writing clean code, and designing the engine to be very extensible. The early plans to design an extensible multi-generational engine happened to give us a great advantage in licensing the technology as it reached completion. After we did a couple of licensing deals, we realised it was a legitimate business. Since then, it has become a major component of our strategy.
